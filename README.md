# Bike Rental Demand Analysis and Forecasting

This repository showcases a data science project focused on analyzing and forecasting bike demand for a rental service. In an increasingly competitive and optimization-driven environment, data science plays a crucial role in transforming raw data into actionable insights that aid in strategic decision-making.

## Importance of the Project

The project aims to enhance the operational efficiency of the bike rental service by providing accurate forecasts of future demand. With advanced data science techniques, such as predictive modeling, it is possible to anticipate customer needs, optimize inventory management, and consequently increase customer satisfaction and business profitability.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Loading**: Importing historical data from the rental service to set the stage for more in-depth analysis.
  
2. **Data Processing**: Cleaning and transforming the data to ensure accuracy and relevance of the insights obtained. This step includes normalizing and manipulating the data to prepare it for predictive modeling.

3. **Exploratory Analysis**: Detailed exploration of the data to identify patterns, trends, and seasonality. This step helps understand the dynamics of demand and better prepare the data for modeling.

4. **Predictive Modeling**: Implementing the Prophet model to forecast future demand based on historical data. Prophet is an advanced tool that captures trends and seasonality, providing more accurate and reliable forecasts.

## Repository Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing the exploratory data analysis and the Prophet model implementation.
- `data/`: Directory with the datasets used in the project.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data processing and forecast generation.
- `results/`: Forecast results and generated visualizations.

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to provide a clear view of future bike demand, helping the rental service make informed decisions about inventory management and strategic planning. Through data analysis and predictive modeling, we aim to optimize operations and improve customer experience.
